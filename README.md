# mocha-demo

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. 
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. 
Hosted on GitHub.

Mocha – the core framework: it provides common testing functions including describe and it and the main function that runs tests.
Chai – the library with many assertions. It allows to use a lot of different assertions, for now we need only assert.equal.
Sinon – a library to spy over functions, emulate built-in functions and more, we’ll need it much later.
